    question: "What's the risk of working with you?",
    answer: "We're transparent about being a small team. The risk is we might not be the right fit for massive enterprise projects. But for startups and growing companies, we offer speed, flexibility, and personal attention that big agencies can't match."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can you ship?",
    answer: "With no-code tools, we can have your MVP live in days, not months. External pages with custom code take 1-2 weeks. The beauty of our approach is you see progress immediately and can iterate based on real user feedback."
