8 quick tips to instantly improve your design with proper use of space.

## 1. White space = breathing room

White space isn't wasted space.

It naturally guides your users' eyes through your design, reduces overwhelm, clarifies hierarchy, and makes content easily digestible.

## 2. Group & separate with space

Use tighter spacing to group related items. Increase space to clearly separate unrelated sections.

Good spacing naturally clarifies your design structure.

## 3. Stay consistent

Use the same spacing for similar elements everywhere in your design.

Consistent spacing creates visual harmony and prevents chaos.

## 4. White space around CTAs

Generous spacing around buttons draws more attention and increases conversions.

If you want users to click, make sure your CTA has enough breathing room.
